# Romantism
*A student staying on campus*

*Pursuing my dream with a small game*

*Learning Python with all my might*

*To make my vision a reality.*  
<br>

*In the silence of the night*

*I type away with all my might*

*Creating worlds and characters*

*With my imagination and my wits.*  
<br>

*The game may be simple and unrefined*

*But it holds a special place in my mind*

*As I learn and grow and explore*

*The possibilities of code.*  
<br>

*So let us celebrate this feat*

*Of a student staying on his feet*

*And using his talents to create*

*A world of his own, both fun and great.*
